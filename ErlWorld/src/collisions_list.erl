%%% @author Joseph Lenton
%%% @doc A list based collisions object that implements the collisions module.
%%% The functions used in the collisions module can be used for interacting with
%%% this collisions object. This is a simple brute force list based collisions
%%% object, however the checks are performed in their own process allowing
%%% multiple checks to be performed at once.
