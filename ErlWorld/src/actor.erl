%%% @doc
%%% The Actor module defines how to create and interact with Actors in the world.
%%% 
%%% An Actor is made up of three aspects:<br />
%%%     = State - an instance of actor_state<br />
%%%     = Act - A callback function defining how to update this Actors state.<br />
%%%     = Paint - A callback function defining how to paint.<br />
%%%
%%%     <em>Actor State</em><br />
%%% The ActorState should be an instance made from the actor_state module (or a
%%% conceptual sub-class of this). Custom properties can be added to the
%%% actor_state when it is setup.
%%%
%%%     <em>Act( State::actor_state(), Parent::pid() ) -> NewState::actor_state()</em><br />
%%% The Act function defines how to change or update the Actors actor_state on
%%% each frame. The result of this function is the Actors state for the next
%%% frame. The signature of the Act function must be in the format stated above.
%%% The parent is PID to the World that this Actor is in.
%%%
%%%     <em>Paint( State::actor_state(), G::graphics() ) -> ok</em><br />
%%% The Paint function defines how to paint the Actors actor_state to the
%%% screen. The result of this callback function is ignored. The function must
%%% be in the signature defined above. The given graphics object, G, can be
%%% passed into the functions in the graphics module to perform drawing.
